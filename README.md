## :clapper: Introduction

The demo aims to showcase a novel matching paradigm, proposed at [ICCV 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Bartolomei_Active_Stereo_Without_Pattern_Projector_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf), based on projecting virtual patterns onto conventional stereo pairs according to the sparse depth points gathered by a depth sensor to achieve robust and dense depth estimation at the resolution of the input images.
We will showcase to the CVPR community how flexible and effective the virtual pattern projection paradigm is through a real-time demo based on off-the-shelf cameras and depth sensors.

## :memo: Code

You can build our prototype from scratch using our code and your L515 and OAK-D Lite sensors. We tested our code using both Jetson Nano (arm64) and a standard amd64 ubuntu PC.


### :hammer_and_wrench: Setup Instructions

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies. The list of dependencies can be found in the `./requirements.txt` file.

2. **Calibration (1)**: Ensure that L515 and OAK-D Lite are rigidly attached to each other (you can build our [aluminium support](cad/CVPR-DEMO_CAD.pdf)). Given a [chessboard calibration object](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/doc/pattern.png), please record a sequence of frame where the chessboard is visible on both OAK-D left camera and L515 IR camera using our script:

```bash
python calibration_recorder.py --outdir <chessboard_folder>
```

3. **Calibration (2)**: Estimate the rigid transformation between L515 IR camera and OAK-D left camera using the previous recorder frames and our script (edit arguments ```square_size``` and ```grid_size``` to match your chessboard object):

```bash
python calibration.py --dataset_dir <chessboard_folder> --square_size 17 --grid_size 9 6
```

4. **Launch the demo**: Run our ```demo.py``` script to see our virtual pattern projection (VPP) in real-time.
